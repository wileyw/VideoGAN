## Overview
We reimplemented a Video GAN Neural Network in order to generate synthetic Pacman images. In this project, we explore generating video frames as opposed to generating a single image.

## Discriminator

## Generator
The generator accepts a history of 4 frames to generate an unknown 5th frame. The history of 4 frames is stacked together as input to the Generator network.

## Loss Function
